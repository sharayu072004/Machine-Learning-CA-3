        "**Summary of Findings:**\n",
        "\n",
        "We trained and evaluated four different machine learning models (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and Random Forest Classifier) to classify e-commerce product titles and descriptions into four categories: Electronics, Household, Books, and Clothing & Accessories.\n",
        "\n",
        "After cleaning and preprocessing the text data using TF-IDF vectorization, the models were trained on the training set and evaluated on a held-out test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results on the test set are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** Achieved an accuracy of approximately 0.9385. This model is often a good baseline for text classification tasks due to its simplicity and efficiency.\n",
        "*   **Logistic Regression:** Showed improved performance with an accuracy of around 0.9647, indicating that a linear model with regularization is effective for this dataset.\n",
        "*   **Linear SVM:** Outperformed the other models with the highest accuracy of approximately 0.9788. Support Vector Machines are known for their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces, which is characteristic of TF-IDF vectorized data.\n",
        "*   **Random Forest Classifier:** Achieved an accuracy of about 0.9714, performing slightly better than Logistic Regression but not as well as Linear SVM. Ensemble methods like Random Forest can capture complex interactions but might be more computationally expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these results, the **Linear SVM** model demonstrated the best performance in classifying e-commerce product descriptions for this dataset, achieving the highest accuracy on the test set. The classification reports for each model also provide more detailed insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for each category, which can be further analyzed for specific strengths and weaknesses of each model."
